Installation Instructions:
	Extract the mod_GoogleMap Installer archive out of this archive, but don't unpack it.

	In the Joomla! administration area, go to:
		Extensions > Install/Uninstall. In the upload box,
	Then select the archive containing mod_GoogleMap on your HD, select it, and click "Upload and Install."

	After installation, enable the Module from:
		Extensions > Moduele Manager > mod_GoogleMap
	Before you can use the module, you will have to change the settings of the Module.
	In the current version there are many parameters. The meaning of them can be read out in the official
		mod_GoogleMap documentation, delivered in this packet or at http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/mod_googlemap/.
	SOME PARAMS ARE VERY SPECIAL! IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO READ THE DOCUMENTATION BEFORE USING mod_GoogleMap.
		
Attention: This Setting is important, without this, your module won't work:
GoogleMaps API Key: You will need your own key to use the Google Maps API on your website.
		Visit "http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html"
	to get your own Key. After registering copy your Key into the text-area.

		Now the Map should work, using the other default settings. But such a map wouldn't make any
		sense. So you should reset the next Values, to get your own map.

Notes:
	This version - 0.5 - is temporary the final version. But I have some more ideas to get made. I surely will produce
	another version in future. And then I will produce the new one and update the old one, if anybody reports problems
	on using it to me. Feel free to do so. And feel free to ask me for new features.
